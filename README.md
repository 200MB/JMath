# JMath
 JMath(c++) is just my attempt to add as many mathematical (arithmetic) formulas as i can (basically extend math.h).
 i've also decided to add other helpful functions/methods that are not completely focused on math.
 You can use every part of the code but please do link this page if you're going to use it for a public project. thank you
 
 I'm going to update it weekly(unless i gotta have to implement a difficult formula/function/method).
 
 edit 1:
 i'm going to add more methods/functions that aren't just (formulas) like for example Find the most frequent number in a vector etc
