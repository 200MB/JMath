# JMath
 JMath(c++) is just my attempt to add as much mathematical (arithmetic) formulas as i can (basically extend math.h).
 You can use every part of the code but please do link this page if you're going to use it for a public project. thank you
 
 I'm going to update it weekly(unless i gotta have to implement a difficult formula).
