# JMath
 JMath(c++) is just my attempt to add as much mathematical (arithmetic) formulas as i can (basically extend math.h).
 You can use every part of the code but please do link this page if you're going to use it for a public project. thank you
 
 now it might seem dead some times but its not. it will be updated weekly until i say that its DONE
